8	0	22	A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you have any hash indexes on interval columns, you must REINDEX them after updating to 8.0.22. Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes for 8.0.6.
8	0	8	A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes for 8.0.6. Full security against the SQL-injection attacks described in CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314 might require changes in application code. If you have applications that embed untrustworthy strings into SQL commands, you should examine them as soon as possible to ensure that they are using recommended escaping techniques. In most cases, applications should be using subroutines provided by libraries or drivers (such as libpq 's PQescapeStringConn() ) to perform string escaping, rather than relying on ad hoc code to do it.
8	0	6	A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.3, see the release notes for 8.0.3. Also, you might need to REINDEX indexes on textual columns after updating, if you are affected by the locale or plperl issues described below.
8	0	3	A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, it is one possible way of handling two significant security problems that have been found in the initial contents of 8.0.X system catalogs. A dump/initdb/reload sequence using 8.0.3's initdb will automatically correct these problems. The larger security problem is that the built-in character set encoding conversion functions can be invoked from SQL commands by unprivileged users, but the functions were not designed for such use and are not secure against malicious choices of arguments. The fix involves changing the declared parameter list of these functions so that they can no longer be invoked from SQL commands. (This does not affect their normal use by the encoding conversion machinery.) The lesser problem is that the contrib/tsearch2 module creates several functions that are improperly declared to return internal when they do not accept internal arguments. This breaks type safety for all functions using internal arguments. It is strongly recommended that all installations repair these errors, either by initdb or by following the manual repair procedure given below. The errors at least allow unprivileged database users to crash their server process, and might allow unprivileged users to gain the privileges of a database superuser. If you wish not to do an initdb, perform the same manual repair procedures shown in the 7.4.8 release notes .
8	0	2	A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.*. This release updates the major version number of the PostgreSQL libraries, so it might be necessary to re-link some user applications if they cannot find the properly-numbered shared library.
8	0	1	A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.0.
8	0	0	A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate data from any previous release. Observe the following incompatibilities: In READ COMMITTED serialization mode, volatile functions now see the results of concurrent transactions committed up to the beginning of each statement within the function, rather than up to the beginning of the interactive command that called the function. Functions declared STABLE or IMMUTABLE always use the snapshot of the calling query, and therefore do not see the effects of actions taken after the calling query starts, whether in their own transaction or other transactions. Such a function must be read-only, too, meaning that it cannot use any SQL commands other than SELECT . Nondeferred AFTER triggers are now fired immediately after completion of the triggering query, rather than upon finishing the current interactive command. This makes a difference when the triggering query occurred within a function: the trigger is invoked before the function proceeds to its next operation. Server configuration parameters virtual_host and tcpip_socket have been replaced with a more general parameter listen_addresses . Also, the server now listens on localhost by default, which eliminates the need for the -i postmaster switch in many scenarios. Server configuration parameters SortMem and VacuumMem have been renamed to work_mem and maintenance_work_mem to better reflect their use. The original names are still supported in SET and SHOW . Server configuration parameters log_pid , log_timestamp , and log_source_port have been replaced with a more general parameter log_line_prefix . Server configuration parameter syslog has been replaced with a more logical log_destination variable to control the log output destination. Server configuration parameter log_statement has been changed so it can selectively log just database modification or data definition statements. Server configuration parameter log_duration now prints only when log_statement prints the query. Server configuration parameter max_expr_depth parameter has been replaced with max_stack_depth which measures the physical stack size rather than the expression nesting depth. This helps prevent session termination due to stack overflow caused by recursive functions. The length() function no longer counts trailing spaces in CHAR(n) values. Casting an integer to BIT(N) selects the rightmost N bits of the integer, not the leftmost N bits as before. Updating an element or slice of a NULL array value now produces a nonnull array result, namely an array containing just the assigned-to positions. Syntax checking of array input values has been tightened up considerably. Junk that was previously allowed in odd places with odd results now causes an error. Empty-string element values must now be written as "" , rather than writing nothing. Also changed behavior with respect to whitespace surrounding array elements: trailing whitespace is now ignored, for symmetry with leading whitespace (which has always been ignored). Overflow in integer arithmetic operations is now detected and reported as an error. The arithmetic operators associated with the single-byte "char" data type have been removed. The extract() function (also called date_part ) now returns the proper year for BC dates. It previously returned one less than the correct year. The function now also returns the proper values for millennium and century. CIDR values now must have their nonmasked bits be zero. For example, we no longer allow 204.248.199.1/31 as a CIDR value. Such values should never have been accepted by PostgreSQL and will now be rejected. EXECUTE now returns a completion tag that matches the executed statement. psql 's \\copy command now reads or writes to the query's stdin/stdout , rather than psql 's stdin/stdout . The previous behavior can be accessed via new pstdin / pstdout parameters. The JDBC client interface has been removed from the core distribution, and is now hosted at . The Tcl client interface has also been removed. There are several Tcl interfaces now hosted at . The server now uses its own time zone database, rather than the one supplied by the operating system. This will provide consistent behavior across all platforms. In most cases, there should be little noticeable difference in time zone behavior, except that the time zone names used by SET / SHOW TimeZone might be different from what your platform provides. Configure 's threading option no longer requires users to run tests or edit configuration files; threading options are now detected automatically. Now that tablespaces have been implemented, initlocation has been removed. The API for user-defined GiST indexes has been changed. The Union and PickSplit methods are now passed a pointer to a special GistEntryVector structure, rather than a bytea .

8	1	4	A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.2, see the release notes for 8.1.2.

8	1	1	A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X.
8	1	0	A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate data from any previous release. The 8.0 release announced that the to_char() function for intervals would be removed in 8.1. However, since no better API has been suggested, to_char(interval) has been enhanced in 8.1 and will remain in the server. Observe the following incompatibilities: add_missing_from is now false by default (Neil) By default, we now generate an error if a table is used in a query without a FROM reference. The old behavior is still available, but the parameter must be set to 'true' to obtain it. It might be necessary to set add_missing_from to true in order to load an existing dump file, if the dump contains any views or rules created using the implicit- FROM syntax. This should be a one-time annoyance, because PostgreSQL 8.1 will convert such views and rules to standard explicit- FROM syntax. Subsequent dumps will therefore not have the problem. Cause input of a zero-length string ( '' ) for float4 / float8 / oid to throw an error, rather than treating it as a zero (Neil) This change is consistent with the current handling of zero-length strings for integers. The schedule for this change was announced in 8.0. default_with_oids is now false by default (Neil) With this option set to false, user-created tables no longer have an OID column unless WITH OIDS is specified in CREATE TABLE . Though OIDs have existed in all releases of PostgreSQL , their use is limited because they are only four bytes long and the counter is shared across all installed databases. The preferred way of uniquely identifying rows is via sequences and the SERIAL type, which have been supported since PostgreSQL 6.4. Add E'' syntax so eventually ordinary strings can treat backslashes literally (Bruce) Currently PostgreSQL processes a backslash in a string literal as introducing a special escape sequence, e.g. \\n or \\010 . While this allows easy entry of special values, it is nonstandard and makes porting of applications from other databases more difficult. For this reason, the PostgreSQL project is planning to remove the special meaning of backslashes in strings. For backward compatibility and for users who want special backslash processing, a new string syntax has been created. This new string syntax is formed by writing an E immediately preceding the single quote that starts the string, e.g. E'hi\\n' . While this release does not change the handling of backslashes in strings, it does add new configuration parameters to help users migrate applications for future releases: standard_conforming_strings &mdash; does this release treat backslashes literally in ordinary strings? escape_string_warning &mdash; warn about backslashes in ordinary (non-E) strings The standard_conforming_strings value is read-only. Applications can retrieve the value to know how backslashes are processed. (Presence of the parameter can also be taken as an indication that E'' string syntax is supported.) In a future release, standard_conforming_strings will be true, meaning backslashes will be treated literally in non-E strings. To prepare for this change, use E'' strings in places that need special backslash processing, and turn on escape_string_warning to find additional strings that need to be converted to use E'' . Also, use two single-quotes ( '' ) to embed a literal single-quote in a string, rather than the PostgreSQL -supported syntax of backslash single-quote ( \\' ). The former is standards-conforming and does not require the use of the E'' string syntax. You can also use the $$ string syntax, which does not treat backslashes specially. Make REINDEX DATABASE reindex all indexes in the database (Tom) Formerly, REINDEX DATABASE reindexed only system tables. This new behavior seems more intuitive. A new command REINDEX SYSTEM provides the old functionality of reindexing just the system tables. Read-only large object descriptors now obey MVCC snapshot semantics When a large object is opened with INV_READ (and not INV_WRITE ), the data read from the descriptor will now reflect a snapshot of the large object's state at the time of the transaction snapshot in use by the query that called lo_open() . To obtain the old behavior of always returning the latest committed data, include INV_WRITE in the mode flags for lo_open() . Add proper dependencies for arguments of sequence functions (Tom) In previous releases, sequence names passed to nextval() , currval() , and setval() were stored as simple text strings, meaning that renaming or dropping a sequence used in a DEFAULT clause made the clause invalid. This release stores all newly-created sequence function arguments as internal OIDs, allowing them to track sequence renaming, and adding dependency information that prevents improper sequence removal. It also makes such DEFAULT clauses immune to schema renaming and search path changes. Some applications might rely on the old behavior of run-time lookup for sequence names. This can still be done by explicitly casting the argument to text , for example nextval('myseq'::text) . Pre-8.1 database dumps loaded into 8.1 will use the old text-based representation and therefore will not have the features of OID-stored arguments. However, it is possible to update a database containing text-based DEFAULT clauses. First, save this query into a file, such as fixseq.sql : SELECT 'ALTER TABLE ' || pg_catalog.quote_ident(n.nspname) || '.' || pg_catalog.quote_ident(c.relname) || ' ALTER COLUMN ' || pg_catalog.quote_ident(a.attname) || ' SET DEFAULT ' || regexp_replace(d.adsrc, $$val\\(\\(('[^']*')::text\\)::regclass$$, $$val(\\1$$, 'g') || ';' FROM pg_namespace n, pg_class c, pg_attribute a, pg_attrdef d WHERE n.oid = c.relnamespace AND c.oid = a.attrelid AND a.attrelid = d.adrelid AND a.attnum = d.adnum AND d.adsrc ~ $$val\\(\\('[^']*'::text\\)::regclass$$; Next, run the query against a database to find what adjustments are required, like this for database db1 : psql -t -f fixseq.sql db1 This will show the ALTER TABLE commands needed to convert the database to the newer OID-based representation. If the commands look reasonable, run this to update the database: psql -t -f fixseq.sql db1 | psql -e db1 This process must be repeated in each database to be updated. In psql , treat unquoted \\{digit}+ sequences as octal (Bruce) In previous releases, \\{digit}+ sequences were treated as decimal, and only \\0{digit}+ were treated as octal. This change was made for consistency. Remove grammar productions for prefix and postfix % and ^ operators (Tom) These have never been documented and complicated the use of the modulus operator ( % ) with negative numbers. Make &amp;&lt; and &amp;&gt; for polygons consistent with the box "over" operators (Tom) CREATE LANGUAGE can ignore the provided arguments in favor of information from pg_pltemplate (Tom) A new system catalog pg_pltemplate has been defined to carry information about the preferred definitions of procedural languages (such as whether they have validator functions). When an entry exists in this catalog for the language being created, CREATE LANGUAGE will ignore all its parameters except the language name and instead use the catalog information. This measure was taken because of increasing problems with obsolete language definitions being loaded by old dump files. As of 8.1, pg_dump will dump procedural language definitions as just CREATE LANGUAGE name , relying on a template entry to exist at load time. We expect this will be a more future-proof representation. Make pg_cancel_backend(int) return a boolean rather than an integer (Neil) Some users are having problems loading UTF-8 data into 8.1.X. This is because previous versions allowed invalid UTF-8 byte sequences to be entered into the database, and this release properly accepts only valid UTF-8 sequences. One way to correct a dumpfile is to run the command iconv -c -f UTF-8 -t UTF-8 -o cleanfile.sql dumpfile.sql . The -c option removes invalid character sequences. A diff of the two files will show the sequences that are invalid. iconv reads the entire input file into memory so it might be necessary to use split to break up the dump into multiple smaller files for processing.
8	2	14	A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X. However, if you have any hash indexes on interval columns, you must REINDEX them after updating to 8.2.14. Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.2.11, see the release notes for 8.2.11.
8	2	11	A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X. However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.2.7, see the release notes for 8.2.7. Also, if you were running a previous 8.2.X release, it is recommended to REINDEX all GiST indexes after the upgrade.
8	2	7	A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X. However, you might need to REINDEX indexes on textual columns after updating, if you are affected by the Windows locale issue described below.
8	2	1	A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.
8	2	0	A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate data from any previous release. Observe the following incompatibilities: Set escape_string_warning to on by default (Bruce) This issues a warning if backslash escapes are used in non-escape (non- E'' ) strings . Change the row constructor syntax ( ROW(...) ) so that list elements foo.* will be expanded to a list of their member fields, rather than creating a nested row type field as formerly (Tom) The new behavior is substantially more useful since it allows, for example, triggers to check for data changes with IF row(new.*) IS DISTINCT FROM row(old.*) . The old behavior is still available by omitting .* . Make row comparisons follow SQL standard semantics and allow them to be used in index scans (Tom) Previously, row = and &lt;&gt; comparisons followed the standard but &lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;= did not. A row comparison can now be used as an index constraint for a multicolumn index matching the row value. Make row IS NOT NULL tests follow SQL standard semantics (Tom) The former behavior conformed to the standard for simple cases with IS NULL , but IS NOT NULL would return true if any row field was non-null, whereas the standard says it should return true only when all fields are non-null. Make SET CONSTRAINT affect only one constraint (Kris Jurka) In previous releases, SET CONSTRAINT modified all constraints with a matching name. In this release, the schema search path is used to modify only the first matching constraint. A schema specification is also supported. This more nearly conforms to the SQL standard. Remove RULE permission for tables, for security reasons (Tom) As of this release, only a table's owner can create or modify rules for the table. For backwards compatibility, GRANT / REVOKE RULE is still accepted, but it does nothing. Array comparison improvements (Tom) Now array dimensions are also compared. Change array concatenation to match documented behavior (Tom) This changes the previous behavior where concatenation would modify the array lower bound. Make command-line options of postmaster and postgres identical (Peter) This allows the postmaster to pass arguments to each backend without using -o . Note that some options are now only available as long-form options, because there were conflicting single-letter options. Deprecate use of postmaster symbolic link (Peter) postmaster and postgres commands now act identically, with the behavior determined by command-line options. The postmaster symbolic link is kept for compatibility, but is not really needed. Change log_duration to output even if the query is not output (Tom) In prior releases, log_duration only printed if the query appeared earlier in the log. Make to_char(time) and to_char(interval) treat HH and HH12 as 12-hour intervals Most applications should use HH24 unless they want a 12-hour display. Zero unmasked bits in conversion from INET to CIDR (Tom) This ensures that the converted value is actually valid for CIDR . Remove australian_timezones configuration variable (Joachim Wieland) This variable has been superseded by a more general facility for configuring timezone abbreviations. Improve cost estimation for nested-loop index scans (Tom) This might eliminate the need to set unrealistically small values of random_page_cost . If you have been using a very small random_page_cost , please recheck your test cases. Change behavior of pg_dump -n and -t options. (Greg Sabino Mullane) See the pg_dump manual page for details. Change libpq PQdsplen() to return a useful value (Martijn van Oosterhout) Declare libpq PQgetssl() as returning void * , rather than SSL * (Martijn van Oosterhout) This allows applications to use the function without including the OpenSSL headers. C-language loadable modules must now include a PG_MODULE_MAGIC macro call for version compatibility checking (Martijn van Oosterhout) For security's sake, modules used by a PL/PerlU function are no longer available to PL/Perl functions (Andrew) This also implies that data can no longer be shared between a PL/Perl function and a PL/PerlU function. Some Perl installations have not been compiled with the correct flags to allow multiple interpreters to exist within a single process. In this situation PL/Perl and PL/PerlU cannot both be used in a single backend. The solution is to get a Perl installation which supports multiple interpreters. In contrib/xml2/ , rename xml_valid() to xml_is_well_formed() (Tom) xml_valid() will remain for backward compatibility, but its behavior will change to do schema checking in a future release. Remove contrib/ora2pg/ , now at Remove contrib modules that have been migrated to PgFoundry: adddepend , dbase , dbmirror , fulltextindex , mac , userlock Remove abandoned contrib modules: mSQL-interface , tips Remove QNX and BEOS ports (Bruce) These ports no longer had active maintainers.

The previous fixes were narrowly tailored for the original problem reports, but we have now recognized that any error thrown by an encoding conversion function could potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying to report the error. The solution therefore is to disable translation and encoding conversion and report the plain-ASCII form of any error message, if we find we have gotten into a recursive error reporting situation.

8	0	15	c4b6b648c757bf7b40c847509e1b8633	Prevent functions in indexes from executing with the privileges of the user running VACUUM , ANALYZE , etc (Tom) Functions used in index expressions and partial-index predicates are evaluated whenever a new table entry is made. It has long been understood that this poses a risk of trojan-horse code execution if one modifies a table owned by an untrustworthy user. (Note that triggers, defaults, check constraints, etc. pose the same type of risk.) But functions in indexes pose extra danger because they will be executed by routine maintenance operations such as VACUUM FULL , which are commonly performed automatically under a superuser account. For example, a nefarious user can execute code with superuser privileges by setting up a trojan-horse index definition and waiting for the next routine vacuum. The fix arranges for standard maintenance operations (including VACUUM , ANALYZE , REINDEX , and CLUSTER ) to execute as the table owner rather than the calling user, using the same privilege-switching mechanism already used for SECURITY DEFINER functions. To prevent bypassing this security measure, execution of SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION and SET ROLE is now forbidden within a SECURITY DEFINER context.

By default, \\' is rejected only when client_encoding is set to a client-only encoding (SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, or UHC), which is the scenario in which SQL injection is possible. A new configuration parameter backslash_quote is available to adjust this behavior when needed. Note that full security against CVE-2006-2314 might require client-side changes; the purpose of backslash_quote is in part to make it obvious that insecure clients are insecure.

While prepared queries avoid the overhead of re-planning on each use, the quality of the plan suffers from not knowing the exact parameters to be used in the query. In this release, planning of unnamed prepared statements is delayed until the first execution, and the actual parameter values of that execution are used as optimization hints. This allows use of out-of-line parameter passing without incurring a performance penalty.

The previous fixes were narrowly tailored for the original problem reports, but we have now recognized that any error thrown by an encoding conversion function could potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying to report the error. The solution therefore is to disable translation and encoding conversion and report the plain-ASCII form of any error message, if we find we have gotten into a recursive error reporting situation.

This caused no immediate problems, since the permissions on the TOAST rowtype aren't examined by any ordinary database operation. However, it could lead to unexpected failures if one later tried to drop the role that issued the command (in 8.1 or 8.2), or owner of data type appears to be invalid warnings from pg_dump after having done so (in 8.3).

Since this could result in pg_dump output failing to reload, it is being treated as a high-priority fix. The only released versions in which dump output is actually incorrect are 8.3.1 and 8.2.7.

8	1	11	c4b6b648c757bf7b40c847509e1b8633	Prevent functions in indexes from executing with the privileges of the user running VACUUM , ANALYZE , etc (Tom) Functions used in index expressions and partial-index predicates are evaluated whenever a new table entry is made. It has long been understood that this poses a risk of trojan-horse code execution if one modifies a table owned by an untrustworthy user. (Note that triggers, defaults, check constraints, etc. pose the same type of risk.) But functions in indexes pose extra danger because they will be executed by routine maintenance operations such as VACUUM FULL , which are commonly performed automatically under a superuser account. For example, a nefarious user can execute code with superuser privileges by setting up a trojan-horse index definition and waiting for the next routine vacuum. The fix arranges for standard maintenance operations (including VACUUM , ANALYZE , REINDEX , and CLUSTER ) to execute as the table owner rather than the calling user, using the same privilege-switching mechanism already used for SECURITY DEFINER functions. To prevent bypassing this security measure, execution of SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION and SET ROLE is now forbidden within a SECURITY DEFINER context.

By default, \\' is rejected only when client_encoding is set to a client-only encoding (SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, or UHC), which is the scenario in which SQL injection is possible. A new configuration parameter backslash_quote is available to adjust this behavior when needed. Note that full security against CVE-2006-2314 might require client-side changes; the purpose of backslash_quote is in part to make it obvious that insecure clients are insecure.

This change creates a conceptual distinction between intervals of so many days and intervals of so many hours . Adding 1 day to a timestamp now gives the same local time on the next day even if a daylight saving time adjustment occurs between, whereas adding 24 hours will give a different local time when this happens.

The previous fixes were narrowly tailored for the original problem reports, but we have now recognized that any error thrown by an encoding conversion function could potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying to report the error. The solution therefore is to disable translation and encoding conversion and report the plain-ASCII form of any error message, if we find we have gotten into a recursive error reporting situation.

8	2	6	c4b6b648c757bf7b40c847509e1b8633	Prevent functions in indexes from executing with the privileges of the user running VACUUM , ANALYZE , etc (Tom) Functions used in index expressions and partial-index predicates are evaluated whenever a new table entry is made. It has long been understood that this poses a risk of trojan-horse code execution if one modifies a table owned by an untrustworthy user. (Note that triggers, defaults, check constraints, etc. pose the same type of risk.) But functions in indexes pose extra danger because they will be executed by routine maintenance operations such as VACUUM FULL , which are commonly performed automatically under a superuser account. For example, a nefarious user can execute code with superuser privileges by setting up a trojan-horse index definition and waiting for the next routine vacuum. The fix arranges for standard maintenance operations (including VACUUM , ANALYZE , REINDEX , and CLUSTER ) to execute as the table owner rather than the calling user, using the same privilege-switching mechanism already used for SECURITY DEFINER functions. To prevent bypassing this security measure, execution of SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION and SET ROLE is now forbidden within a SECURITY DEFINER context.

8	3	7	823a5ca6b2bbd23f7396677c912fcb2a	Prevent error recursion crashes when encoding conversion fails (Tom) This change extends fixes made in the last two minor releases for related failure scenarios. The previous fixes were narrowly tailored for the original problem reports, but we have now recognized that any error thrown by an encoding conversion function could potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying to report the error. The solution therefore is to disable translation and encoding conversion and report the plain-ASCII form of any error message, if we find we have gotten into a recursive error reporting situation. (CVE-2009-0922)	'-0922':97 '-2009':96 'ascii':77 'chang':11 'convers':7,48,71 'could':50 'crash':4 'cve':95 'disabl':67 'encod':6,47,70 'error':2,43,61,81,92 'extend':12 'fail':8 'failur':23 'find':85 'fix':13,27 'form':78 'function':49 'gotten':88 'infinit':54 'last':17 'lead':52 'made':14 'messag':82 'minor':19 'narrowli':29 'origin':33 'plain':76 'plain-ascii':75 'potenti':51 'prevent':1 'previous':26 'problem':34 'recogn':40 'recurs':3,55,91 'relat':22 'releas':20 'report':35,59,73,93 'scenario':24 'situat':94 'solut':63 'tailor':30 'therefor':64 'thrown':44 'tom':9 'translat':68 'tri':57 'two':18

8	3	7	ffa2a73790215ba3d40a7fa5168cebf4	Fix xpath() to not modify the path expression unless necessary, and to make a saner attempt at it when necessary (Andrew) The SQL standard suggests that xpath should work on data that is a document fragment, but libxml doesn't support that, and indeed it's not clear that this is sensible according to the XPath standard. xpath attempted to work around this mismatch by modifying both the data and the path expression, but the modification was buggy and could cause valid searches to fail. Now, xpath checks whether the data is in fact a well-formed document, and if so invokes libxml with no change to the data or path expression. Otherwise, a different modification method that is somewhat less likely to fail is used. The new modification method is still not 100% satisfactory, and it seems likely that no real solution is possible. This patch should therefore be viewed as a band-aid to keep from breaking existing applications unnecessarily. It is likely that PostgreSQL 8.4 will simply reject use of xpath on data that is not a well-formed document.

However, it could lead to unexpected failures if one later tried to drop the role that issued the command (in 8.1 or 8.2), or owner of data type appears to be invalid warnings from pg_dump after having done so (in 8.3).
